# CiviCRM Provider

The CiviCRM provider enables Terraform to manage [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) resources through the CiviCRM API v4. This provider is useful for infrastructure-as-code management of CiviCRM configurations, including groups, ACL roles, custom fields, tags, and more.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    civicrm = {
      source  = "josaur/civicrm"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the CiviCRM provider
provider "civicrm" {
  url     = "https://your-civicrm-instance.org"
  api_key = var.civicrm_api_key
}

# Create a group for volunteers
resource "civicrm_group" "volunteers" {
  name        = "volunteers"
  title       = "Volunteers"
  description = "Active volunteers in the organization"
  is_active   = true
  visibility  = "User and User Admin Only"
}

# Create an ACL role
resource "civicrm_acl_role" "volunteer_manager" {
  name        = "volunteer_manager"
  label       = "Volunteer Manager"
  description = "Can view and edit volunteers"
  is_active   = true
}
```

## Authentication

The provider requires authentication via an API key. You can configure authentication in two ways:

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export CIVICRM_URL="https://your-civicrm-instance.org"
export CIVICRM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Provider Configuration

```terraform
provider "civicrm" {
  url     = "https://your-civicrm-instance.org"
  api_key = "your-api-key"
}
```

-> **Note:** Avoid hardcoding the API key in your configuration. Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.

## Generating an API Key

To generate an API key in CiviCRM:

1. Navigate to **Administer > System Settings > API Keys**
2. Select a user with appropriate permissions
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key and store it securely

The user associated with the API key must have permissions for the resources you want to manage.

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The API key for authenticating with CiviCRM. Can also be set via the CIVICRM_API_KEY environment variable.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Skip TLS certificate verification. Only use for development. Default: false.
